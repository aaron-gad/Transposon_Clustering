# Transposon_Clustering
Analysis of insertion patterns of transposons

Transposons can impact genomic functions and likely influence (and are influenced by) 3D genome organisation. Interestingly, transposons are often found in clusters.  We developed a python analysis script that quantifies how transposon positions deviate from homogeneously distributed control elements and how positions of insertions correlate with open chromatin regions.
