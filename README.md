# Transposon_Clustering
Analysis of insertion patterns and sequence flexibility of transposons

Transposons can impact genomic functions and likely influence (and are influenced by) 3D genome organisation. Interestingly, transposons are often found in clusters.  We developed a python analysis script that quantifies how transposon positions deviate from uniformly distributed control elements and how positions of insertions correlate with open chromatin regions. Transposons may disrupt chromatin organization due to their mechanical properties. We quantify the flexibility of transposons and compare it to reference elements and chromatin regions.
